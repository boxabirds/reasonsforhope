# Reasons for Hope Nov 1, 2020

# No big oil good news, regardless of how positive
From this issue onwards, I shall specifically not cover any positive work being done by any fossil fuel company unless I've assessed they're in "good climate standing": that is:

1. **Ownership**: They've owned up to all their climate violations
2. **Action**: They've taken independently-reviewed action to rectify this
3. **People-friendly**: They are actively supporting career transitions for its fossil fuel employees to clean energy (vs mass redundancies). Without career fears in the balance, millions more people will be pro-green. Fossil fuel companies that just lay off their staff are doing it wrong. 
4. **Green lobbyists**: they have lobbyists in place to advocate clean energy and none for fossil energy.

(Anything else? Comments welcome.)

# Policy

South Korea formally commits to net zero by 2050, joining China and Japan.

This matters because even these simple pronouncements from major international states can be a catalyst for changes in policy worldwide. What about Europe? [EU's Green Deal updates plans to be the first carbon-neutral content](https://flip.it/Ro7jW0).

And when I think about India, I think about new coal power plants and massive pollution. But actually, [India is exceeding targets and breaking emissions records](https://flip.it/AWK8RM): "India to be on track to significantly exceed two key commitments to the Paris Agreement. One is India’s pledge to increase the share of power-generation capacity that doesn’t use fossil fuels to 40 percent by 2030; today, generation capacity from renewable, hydroelectric, and nuclear sources already reaches 38 percent, putting India on track to comfortably exceed its target. The other commitment is to reduce carbon emissions by 33 to 35 percent (from 2005 levels) by 2030. Today, India looks likely to reduce emissions by as much as 45 percent by 2030, far surpassing its Paris target."

Fun fact: Bhutan and Suriname are both [already carbon neutral (or better)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality). 

# Activism 

[Jane Goodall on reasons she has hope](https://flip.it/s_fam5): 
"My main hope lies in the energy and commitment of young people around the world. Once they understand the problems and are empowered to take action, my job is to encourage them and give them hope that together we can turn things around."

# Finance & Investment

# Transport 

[Cleaner shipping](https://flip.it/lGUKDV): Shipping is better than air freight but it still adds to 3% of global emissions. Great news — 66 separate projects under way to evaluate various alternative fuels (and remember commercial sailboats from last week too…). 

# Energy

**Green hydrogen** was in the news a bit recently. It's [being tested as a way to power ships](https://flip.it/2K.4La) and a [Norwegin steelworks is replacing fossil fuel with green hydrogen](https://flip.it/Q9UW9E) too. 


**Solar, wind and wave energy are great but they're not a very reliable source of energy**. So it's useful to it somewhere. And vanadium, a fairly common material, could well be another strong player for bulk energy storage. Longer lifespan than commonplace Li-ion, and not a fire risk. China has had Vanadium energy storage centres for the past couple of years.

# Consumption

[More efficient cooling](https://flip.it/jeheql): a new kind of white paint by Purdue University "reflects 95.5% of sunlight and "can keep surfaces up to 18 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than their ambient surroundings… This paint is basically creating free air conditioning by reflecting that sunlight and offsetting those heat gains from inside your house"

[More efficient food production](https://flip.it/8.T3Za): Air Protein is using everyday fresh air to help create protein thousands of times faster than before.

[More efficient biofuel production](https://flip.it/t5QU6M): biofuels are fuels created from biological material ("feedstocks") such as used cooking oil or agricultural waste, instead of fossil fuels. But current systems can't cope with systems that are more than 1-2% contaminated.
Research from Durham University shows how a new kind of catalyst particle can vastly improve the filtering ability, so that they can handle much lower-grade feedstocks, maybe as much as 50% contaminated. This means the energy and resources required to produce biofuels can come down (which is good because it's a [significant concern](https://www.actionaidusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Water-at-Risk.pdf))

# Waste

[Cheaper and cleaner plastic recycling](https://flip.it/4tkSCq): To recycle the most common plastic, it needs to be heated up very high (500-1000C) with solvents. New research uses a catalyst to reduce the temperature needed to 300C without solvents. $9bn market for this.

[Microsoft and Nonprofite Ocean Cleanup is training AI to identify ocean waste](https://flip.it/8Kemf7). This will aid automated cleanup in future.
