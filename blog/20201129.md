# Reasons for Hope Nov 29, 2020: First country to make Ecocide a crime

# OMG Julian too much text what's the gist
Sorry! There's just too much exciting good news. I'm trying to go t-shaped from now on: I deep dive one area of particular interest, and skim the others. 


- In this issue I deep-dive into virtual power plants, with a case study from Forbes on how it works practically. 
- The cash continues to flow to enable climate crisis solutions. Both in vertical areas (such as hotel investment funds) and horiztonal (Europe-wide)
- Lots of positive progress on country policies. France's doing some particularly interesting things!
- January is a special time for the US because two Senate seats will decide the level of friction Biden & Harris will have on policy enforcement for the rest of the 4 years. This is a critical event on the world stage. 


# Energy: virtual power plants are a proving to be a huge win for everyone

Property developers have huge opportunities to make a big difference because they're enabling consumption at scale. 

Soleil Lofts is a 600 apt complex that has a virtual power plant built-in. It's pretty exciting because of its scale (12MW), making it one of the largest in the world.

- The complex is completely littered with solar panels for capture. (Utah has a bunch of sun.)
- But oversupply and undersupply is a drag, so batteries are a way of smoothing it out. 
- Microgrids and Virtual Power Plants are different ways of sharing energy across households. 
- Another drag: each of the 600+ "swarm-controlled" batteries are super pricy still, $50k or more. 
- So property developers for Soleil Lofts have decided to keep ownership of the batteries. Apt owners get more reliable, discounted and green energy. 
- Obviously as batteries get cheaper, there's a future where this cost is something everyday consumers can afford.

# Natural Resources: Google tree shade tracker 

[Google Canopy Lab tracks shade](https://flip.it/t-U75N): Starting with Los Angeles, CA, Google has launched project Tree Canopy Lab. It looks satellite images of green bits in a map, and makes a judgement on the coverage. Apparently 40% is a key milestone; LA is at 10%. Stay tuned: fingers crossed Google doesn't get bored of this before it scales to global scale.

# Activism: Why Georgia, USA in Jan 2021 could decide the fate of the planet

The ease at which Biden-Harris can execute on their climate change plan will be decided by who wins the George, USA senate run-off. I know almost nothing about most of those words, but I care deeply about the future of a habitable Earth for my kids. So for those who have cash or time, [this is a list of things you can do to help the Democrats secure Georgia](https://flip.it/miNlxo).

A global cleanup operation: we're talking people all over the world, walking around and collecting thousands of tonnes of rubbish then sorting it and in some cases recycling it.
