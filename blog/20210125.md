# Reasons for Hope Jan 25, 2020: Tomato shrubs! and 11 other ways consumption is getting greener

<p><em>Welcome, dear readers! I'm hoping you're reading this because you *want to keep up to date with the climate crisis*, but <b>from an anxiety-free source of inspiration</b>.</em></p>

# Being positive but not toxically so
I looked up the term "toxic positivity" the other day. I asked myself: "Is this newsletter that?" I don't think so. Because toxic positivity is a form of denial, as I understand it, being positive to the point of denying that bad things are happening. 

Believe me, bad things are happening. But there are other sources if you want that. In fact part of what I do to get the great news is to put the bad news I find in a separate magazine. If you are too happy and need some misery, [here's the link](https://flipboard.com/@boxabirds/climate-hopelessness-jh0jh40dy). I don't recommend it though. 

This is designed to be a thoroughly enjoyable 5-10 minute read that inspires and leaves you happy and with a sense of hope and possibility. 

When you have a moment to take a pause, grab a cuppa, take a deep breath, and enjoy this edition of Reasons for Hope. You'll love it. 

# Let's begin. 

Consume, grow, and consume some more. That's basically humanity in a nutshell. So if we want to keep doing this we need to be rather more clever about how we do this. 

And over the past couple of weeks there has been an extraordinary number of updates on better ways to produce food and clean water.
