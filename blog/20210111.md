# Reasons for Hope Jan 11 2021: Green US, Prince Charles' Terra Carta, + Hydrogen in our homes

<p><em>Happy New Year, readers! You're receiving this I'm hoping because you **want to keep up to date with the climate crisis**, but <b>want an anxiety-free experience</b>.</em></p>

I created [Reasons for Hope](http://reasonsforhope.substack.com) for my own desire to an anxiety-free resource: all the other newsletters were a mixed bag: you'd never know whether you'd end up getting all stressed out by some new misery to worry about. I like to choose the flavours of my chocolates!

<p><em>If you know of others who might like this, please forward it to them or send them this link. My email newsletter is getting a 70% open rate. I'm pretty astonished: it's almost unheard of in newsletter circles, so you can be confident to recommend it to others resting assured they'll find it a joy to read.</em></p>

# 2021 could turn out to the most hopeful year yet!


# Policy

 I mentioned before that the "US Senate Georgia runoffs" was an important event on the world stage. 

You don't even need to know what any of those words mean, except to know that, almost unbelievably, it went the way of the climate. 

US's incoming climate-friendly government will now be able to move much much more smoothly to enact Biden-Harris' $2tn+ green initiatives. 

If people thought Obama's administration was climate-friendly, reflect for a moment that he didn't have a senate majority and was up against regular friction as oil & gas interests successfully lobbied the opposition to slow things down (Republicans). 

Pretty exciting way to start 2021!

# Energy

[Hydrogen heating our homes? Trial in Scotland under way](https://flip.it/rShFup). But… Hindenberg? Doesn't hydrogen blow up and kill people? Do we want that in our homes? [Here's a paper on domestic hydrogen heating safety](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095809920302861) (Dec 2020). Hydrogen is actually less flammable than other fuels we use everywhere in houses and cars, and natural gas infrastructure can be used to transport hydrogen:

> The addition of hydrogen into existing natural gas pipelines is a feasible short-term solution for the following reasons. 
> * First, an addition of about 10% into natural gas pipelines is technically feasible, with minor ignition risks, no increase in pipeline fatigue, and no increased leakage risks. 
> * Second, transporting hydrogen via existing natural gas lines is economically acceptable, as it can be treated as an alternative way to decrease the overall high construction cost and to save time during the early market-development phase. 
> * Third, the transportation of flammable gases through existing natural gas pipelines is already accepted by the public. 
> * Last but not least, the operating practice of such cases will be important in order to explore the further utilization of existing natural gas pipelines

* [Georgia, USA first to build an EV-charging solar roadway](https://flip.it/C4UNkM). To be clear, it's in a section of a test track, but it's where such things should be. The French have been leading this. If you followed the hoo-hah about the French solar road last year and how it didn't really work out, well, this is pioneering work. This new iteration uses the same company but with a 21% improvement in efficiency

# Activism & Litigation

[US court case breaks new ground](https://flip.it/k8dyw6) (well, it did in 2015, and is still ongoing) with this question: 

>"Could the Founding Fathers have imagined that Americans would one day be so impacted by others, that nature would be so degraded, that our own environment threatened pregnancy? How would they have wanted us to react to that threat and our rights to be free from others, and free to live our lives as we see fit, relative to the environmental baseline they enjoyed and extolled as a necessary condition of freedom?" -- led by Earth Guardians

You can track that court case and other [climate court cases on Climate Case Chart](https://flip.it/-CtsLi) that also covers non-US litigation.

Climate Case Chart is both an amazing resource and equally due for a bit of a refresh. To get news of updates is actually a bit of a hunt. I've subscribed now and if you want to then [this is the page](https://us13.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=9906c7202590aac6a8bdbb7b9&id=a721b41b2d).

# Finance & Investment

[Prince Charles announces "Terra Carta" project](https://flip.it/Cn32Nh) aiming to secure £7bn+ funding. The Prince has been an environmentalist for 50 years. 

# Transport

[GM moving to huge electric transition](https://flip.it/to.xht). Last issue I talked about how auto manufacturers are panicking because of the tide change in pro-electric, anti-gas policies swelling up across the world. This article is a bit promotional, but it says they're investing $27bn and will have 30 new electric vehicles by 2025. Not to be sneezed at!
