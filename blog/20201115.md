# Reasons for Hope Nov 15, 2020: Biden special issue

Welcome seekers of hope! I've had interest to create an email version of this newsletter so you can [get it delivered via email using this link](https://reasonsforhope.substack.com/p/coming-soon?r=obqn&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy). 

Lots to be hopeful about over the last couple of weeks:


- $57bn investment fund lost a climate change battle
- Russia starting to take the Paris Agreement seriously
- UK nuclear going mini
- More exciting news on bulk energy storage (absolutely critical for harnessing natural energy sources)
- And of course, Biden as president-elect. I certainly learnt a lot more about US government than I ever cared for (being based in London). 


# 2050 is too damn late
![2050 is too damn late](https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/85103196/2050-is-too-damn-late.jpg "2050 is too damn late")

"We're doing magic things by 2050!". That's just lovely, but is it hopeful? I think not. So I'm no longer reporting on any organisation or country that talks about commitments by 2050. 

It's too late and too far away to be meaningful. 

Particularly given overall track records so far of the Paris Agreement (Quick! Name one country that's on track to meet it! Hint: see past issues)


# Biden Biden Biden

The world was collectively getting repetitive strain injury from refreshing browser pages last week. 

Regarding the climate crisis, it really was just too hard to think positively about a future with a tyrant clown president in power. 

Something sembling sanity prevailed though, and Tthere's been a lot of excitement about what the Biden Administration can do. So I'm digging into that a bit this week. 

## [Biden to Implement 10 Major Actions on Day One in Office](https://flip.it/-8sQCQ)
- Use federal government procurement to work towards 100% clean energy and zero-emissions vehicles.
- Make government buildings and facilities more energy efficient
- Limit methane pollution of gas and oil operations with specific requirements
- Implement the Clean Air Act, including an emphasis on fuel-economy standards
- Reduce emissions with updated standards for appliance and building efficiency.
- Focus on liquid fuels, including biofuels and incorporate agriculture into climate solutions
- Make federal permit decisions accountable to emissions standards and make infrastructure investment reduce climate pollution
- Require public companies to disclose climate risks and emissions in operations and supply chain
- Permanently protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
- Protect biodiversity by protecting America’s lands and waters, with a goal of 30% protected by 2030.

- [Domestic friction could be overcome by using international relationships](https://theconversation.com/climate-change-joe-biden-could-ride-a-wave-of-international-momentum-to-break-deadlock-in-us-149121). Biden's impact will be limited by a Republican Senate majority. But playing on the world's stage could provide a way forward.

# This week's favourite YouTube video: cheap, safe bulk energy

[Redox batteries: really cheap and safe bulk energy storage](https://flip.it/_zq9JA). The essence though is that there's a lot of innovation going on in the long-term energy store (more than 4h) so that solar, wind, and waves can be viable energy sources. Geek alert: it talks about ions and charged particles.

# Natural Resources: Coral reef bursts back to life

I wasn't quite sure whether to include this because it wasn't really anything people did. But here we go anyway.

# Policy: Carrie Symonds sells Boris Johnson on green bonds

With Cummings' departure, has UK PM found a new puppetmaster, this time climate-friendly? 

> "Carrie Symonds is passionate about the environmental policy and wants a fund
She has urged Boris Johnson to create 'green bonds' for cutting emissions" -- [Mail Online](https://flip.it/t4Co61)

# Activism: 25yo wins battle against $57bn investment fund over climate change

Quite extraordinary precedent here. This gives me hope because there's so much capital in investment funds and this will help ensure it's being invested sensibly.

# Transport: First human ride on a Hyperloop

These are incredibly efficient ways to travel because of how fast you can potentially go (sometimes faster than aeroplanes). Could hyperloops be the future of transport? In some parts of the world, almost certainly. [Reuters](https://flip.it/AjHpvI)

# Energy: Lots of Nuclear 

It turns out that most nuclear power plants are using technology that is many many decades old. It's now possible to build much smaller ones, and that's precisely what Rolls-Royce plans to do: 16 new mini powerplants in the UK, generating thousands of jobs -- [BBC News](https://flip.it/f3RZqN)

And here's an exciting update on solar power: solar panel windows. 

>“by harvesting only invisible light, these devices can provide a similar electricity-generation potential as rooftop solar while providing additional functionality to enhance the efficiency of buildings, automobiles and mobile electronics." [Treehugger](https://flip.it/567oEk)

Also in Energy news:
- [New nuclear reactor designs much more efficient](https://flip.it/35cgLm). Lots of heat generated that can be put to good use.
- [Positive progress on UK Fusion reactor](https://flip.it/t7NQgE). Much safer as it works with Hydrogen. Still 10+ years away though.

# Consumption

# Waste: creating solid fertiliser from human waste

A bit icky to talk about but yeah turns out our bodies don't need much nitrogen or phosphorus, but that is useful for plants. 

> “The most nutrient-rich part of wastewater is human urine, which makes up less than 1% of the total volume but contains 80% of the nitrogen and 50% of the phosphorus. We discovered how to recycle this urine into valuable – and sustainable – farmland fertiliser.” -- [The Conversation](https://flip.it/sy7fEc)

# Postscript" Shell's Epic Gaffe

Some tone-deaf intern running Shell's social media account was probably fired this week over running a poll to say "what ideas do you have for people to cut emissions". While it's unlikely anything meaningful will come from it, it was a good laugh to see how people patiently pointed out that they were one of the biggest emissions sources and maybe they should stop. I'm putting it mildly. [Source](https://flip.it/t7NQgE)
